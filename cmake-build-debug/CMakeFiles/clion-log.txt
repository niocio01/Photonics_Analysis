CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
  The CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:

    g++.exe

  is not a full path and was not found in the PATH.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the full path
  to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
